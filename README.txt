Automated sms forwarding and more.

=======
The problem with inbuilt message forwarding is that it is very rudimentary and does not work most of the time. The inspiration to make this application came form the frustration I faced everytime paying for my fees using my father's debit card. The OTP which always went to the registered mobile(my father's cell) had to be noticed by him and then forwarded manually to me. Most of the time this resulted in a timeout. My application runs a service which looks for incoming messages and filters them out according to user set rules. So it fetches the bank OTP and sends it to a number set by the user without any intervention. This happens in the background quick and automatically according to user defined rules in the app. This is still under development with many more upcoming features like scheduling, multiple rules,encryption. etc
